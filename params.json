To build it:\r\n\r\n        src/extension mvn assembly:assembly -DdescriptorId=jar-with-dependencies\r\n\r\n2. Copy `src/extension/target/graphify-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar` to the `plugins/` directory of your Neo4j server.\r\n\r\n3. Configure Neo4j by adding a line to conf/neo4j-server.properties:\r\n\r\n        org.neo4j.server.thirdparty_jaxrs_classes=org.neo4j.nlp.ext=/service\r\n\r\n4. Start Neo4j server.\r\n\r\n5.
