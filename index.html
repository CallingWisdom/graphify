<p>This is a Neo4j unmanaged extension used for document and text classification using graph-based hierarchical pattern recognition.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Build it:</p>

<pre><code>mvn assembly:assembly -DdescriptorId=jar-with-dependencies
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Copy target/pattern4j-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar to the plugins/ directory of your Neo4j server.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Configure Neo4j by adding a line to conf/neo4j-server.properties:</p>

<pre><code>org.neo4j.server.thirdparty_jaxrs_classes=org.neo4j.nlp.ext=/service
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Start Neo4j server.</p></li>
<li><p>Query it over HTTP.</p></li>
